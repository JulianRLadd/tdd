<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

- U = "Understand"
- P = "Plan"
- E = "Execute"
- R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?

\*What are we asked to find or show?

\*Can we restate the problem in our own words?

\*Can we think of a picture or diagram that might help us
understand the problem?

\*Is there enough info to enable us to find a solution?

\*What exactly are we being asked to return? A string? An object?
Is it up to our interpretation?

\*Which OOD patterns should we employ?

\*There's no input mechanism, how exactly should we create the desired objects?

\*Which data types should we use?

\*How simple is "simple"?

\* \*

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>

\*Use TDD, write test first followed by code

\*Start simple with simple objects; increase complexity as we code

- Don't worry about OOD as we build; refactor once we are sure the code works

\*Look at other's examples of similar projects to find solutions to blocks

\*Use the strategy design pattern to handle imported,exempt, and regular items

\*Use a stringbuilder for the output, have importedBehaviour insert "imported" into output

\*Use parameterized tests once we've progressed to test multiple items simultaneously

\*As for how simple: "Make it work, make it beautiful, and then make it elegant" - J.L.
